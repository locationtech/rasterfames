# Reading Raster Data

```python, echo=False
from IPython.display import display
import pandas as pd
from pyrasterframes.utils import create_rf_spark_session 
from pyrasterframes.rasterfunctions import *
spark = create_rf_spark_session()
```

RasterFrames registers a DataSource named `raster` that enables reading of GeoTIFFs (and other formats when @ref:[GDAL is installed](getting-started.md#installing-gdal)) from arbitrary URIs. In the examples that follow we'll be reading from a Sentinel 2 scene stored in an AWS S3 bucket.

## Single Raster

The simplest form is reading a single raster from a single URI.

```python read_one_uri
rf = spark.read.raster('https://s22s-test-geotiffs.s3.amazonaws.com/luray_snp/B02.tif')
rf.printSchema()
```

The file at the address above is a valid [Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)](https://www.cogeo.org/), which RasterFrames fully supports. RasterFrames will take advantage of the optimizations in the COG format to enable more efficient reading compared to vanilla GeoTIFFs.  

Let's unpack the `proj_raster` column and look at the contents in more detail. It contains a [_CRS_][CRS], a spatial _extent_ measured in that CRS, and a two-dimensional array of numeric values called a _tile_. 

```python unpack_schema
crs = rf.select(rf_crs("proj_raster").alias("value")).first()

parts = rf.select(
    rf_extent("proj_raster").alias("extent"), 
    rf_tile("proj_raster").alias("tile")
)

print("CRS", crs.value.crsProj4)
parts.show(5, False)

```

You can also see that the single raster has been broken out into many arbitrary non-overlapping regions. Doing so takes advantage of parallel in-memory reads from the cloud hosted data source and allows Spark to work on managable amounts of data per task. 

```python count_by_uri
rf.groupby(rf.proj_raster_path).count().show()
```

Let's select a single tile and view it. The tile preview image as well as the string representation provide some basic information about the tile: it's dimensions as number of columns and rows, and the cell type, or data type of all the cells in the tile. For more about cell types, refer to @ref:[this discussion](nodata-handling.md#cell-types).

```python show_tile_sample
tile = rf.select(rf_tile("proj_raster")).first()[0]
display(tile)
```

## URI Formats

## Raster Catalogs

Considering the definition of a @ref:[_Catalog_](raster-catalogs.md) previously discussed, let's read the raster data contained in the catalog URIs. We will start with the @ref:[external catalog](raster-catalogs.md#using-external-catalogs) of MODIS surface reflectance that we previously demonstrated.

```python catalog_prep
from pyspark import SparkFiles
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

cat_filename = "2018-07-04_scenes.txt"
spark.sparkContext.addFile("https://modis-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/MCD43A4.006/{}".format(cat_filename))

modis_catalog = spark.read \
    .format("csv") \
    .option("header", "true") \
    .load(SparkFiles.get(cat_filename)) \
    .withColumn('base_url', 
        F.concat(F.regexp_replace('download_url', 'index.html$', ''), 'gid',) 
    ) \
    .drop('download_url') \
    .withColumn('red' , F.concat('base_url', F.lit("_B01.TIF"))) \
    .withColumn('nir' , F.concat('base_url', F.lit("_B02.TIF")))

modis_catalog.printSchema()

print("Available scenes: ", modis_catalog.count())

modis_catalog.show(5, truncate=False)
```

MODIS data products are delivered on a regular, consistent grid, making identification of a specific area over time easy using `(h,v)` grid coordinates. 

![MODIS Grid](https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/MODIS_sinusoidal_grid1.gif)

For example, MODIS data right above the equator is all grid coordinates with `v07`.  

```python catalog_filtering
equator = modis_catalog.where(F.col('gid').like('%v07%'))
equator.select('date', 'gid').show(10, False)
```

Now that we have prepared our catalog, we simply pass the DataFrame or CSV string to the `raster` DataSource to load the imagery. The `catalog_col_names` parameter gives the columns that contain the URI's to be read.

```python read_catalog
rf = spark.read.raster(
    catalog=equator, 
    catalog_col_names=['red', 'nir'],
)
rf.printSchema()
```

Observe schema of the resulting dataframe has a projected raster struct for each column passed in `catalog_col_names`. For reference the URI is now in a column appended with `_path`. We can take a quick look at the representation of the data. We see again each row contains an arbitrary portion of the entire scene coverage. We also see that for two-D catalogs, each row contains the same spatial extent from within that coverage.

```python cat_read_sample
rf.select('gid', rf_extent('red'), rf_extent('nir'), rf_tile('red'), rf_tile('nir')).show(3, False)
```

### Lazy Raster Reads

By default the raster reads are delayed as long as possible. The DataFrame will contain metadata and pointers to the appropriate portion of the data until

Consider the following two reads of the same data source. In the first, the lazy case, there is a pointer to the URI, extent and band to read. This will not be evaluated until the cell values are absolutely required. The second case shows the realized tile is queried right away.

```python lazy_demo
uri = 'https://s22s-test-geotiffs.s3.amazonaws.com/luray_snp/B02.tif'
spark.read.raster(uri) \
    .select('proj_raster.tile').show(1, False)

spark.read.raster(uri, lazy_tiles=False) \
    .select('proj_raster.tile').show(1, False)
```

In the initial examples on this page, we used `rf_tile` to explicitly request the realized tile from the lazy representation.

## Multiband Rasters

A multiband raster represents a three dimensional numeric array. The first two dimensions are spatial, and the third dimension is typically designated as different bands. The bands may represent intensity of different wavelengths of light (or other electromagnetic radiation). The different bands may represent other phenomena such as measurement time, quality indications, or additional measurements.

When reading a multiband raster or a _Catalog_ describing multiband rasters, you will need to know ahead of time which bands you want to read. You will specify the bands to read, indexed from zero, passing a list of integers into the `band_indexes` parameter of the `raster` reader. 

For example we can read a four-band (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) image as follows. The individual rows of the resulting dataframe still represent distinct spatial extents, with a projected raster column for each band specified by `band_indexes`.

```python Multiband
mb = spark.read.raster('s3://s22s-test-geotiffs/naip/m_3807863_nw_17_1_20160620.tif', 
                       band_indexes=[0, 1, 2, 3],
                      )
mb.printSchema()
```

If a band is passed into `band_index` that exceeds the number of bands in the raster, a projected raster column will still be generated in the schema but it will be full of `null` values.

You can also pass a `catalog` and `band_indexes` together into the `raster` reader. This will create a projected raster column for the combination of all items passed into `catalog_col_names` and `band_indexes`. Again if a band in `band_indexes` exceeds the number of bands in a raster, it will have a `null` value for the corresponding column.

Here is a trivial example with a _Catalog_ over multiband rasters. We specify two columns containing URIs and two bands, resulting in four projected raster columns.

```python multiband_catalog
import pandas as pd
mb_cat = pd.DataFrame([
    {'foo': 's3://s22s-test-geotiffs/naip/m_3807863_nw_17_1_20160620.tif',
     'bar': 's3://s22s-test-geotiffs/naip/m_3807863_nw_17_1_20160620.tif',
    },
])
mb2 = spark.read.raster(catalog=spark.createDataFrame(mb_cat),
                       catalog_col_names=['foo', 'bar'],
                       band_indexes=[0, 1],
                       tile_dimensions=(64,64)
                      )
mb2.printSchema()
```
